The Headphone Rule
=====

Uses HAML and SASS because awesome although you could just probably edit `index.html` if that's how you roll. I'm not here to judge.

# Dev

1. `bundle install`
2. `foreman start`

# Deploy

I like [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

1. `git branch gh-pages`
2. `git push origin gh-pages`
3. Boom! Check out `your-username.github.com/headphonerule`
